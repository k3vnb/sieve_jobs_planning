#### Planning Session Notes

After re-reading 'Thinking in React' and puzzling over how best to break down my UI, I made a preliminary draft.
###### Flashcard UI

###### Tutorial UI

###### Component Tree Draft

I believe there will need to be lots of revisions, especially to the component tree, at this time I realize the further away I get from the top of the component tree, the more abstract the concept feels, and I think I need to start plugging away at some of the higher components to get a better feel for how the information will start flowing.

###### Mock Ups
I used Google Slides to make some  very basic mock-ups of the pages to help facilitate the understanding of a better component tree

**Landing Page**

The Landing Page will have a more inviting visual element, however at its most basic it will give users the options to route to either flashcard mode or tutorial mode, or to see/edit their previous responses.

**Tutorial Page 1**
![Tutorial1](img/tutorialpage1.jpg?raw=true)
Tutorial page one is a brief tutorial about the kinds of questions that can be asked in an interview. Users are encouraged to click expand to see more & to compose their own stories for answers.

**Tutorial Page 2**

Tutorial page 2 gives more info about the type of question, and suggestions for answering the questions. There is a user input field where the user will enter answers according to suggestions of how to break down the answers.

**Flashcard Page 1**
![Flashcard1](img/flashcardpage1.jpg?raw=true)
Simply the front side of a flashcard, they will be displayed randomly on page load. Users can choose to see 'answers' or to go to next flashcard.

**Flashcard Page 2- Answers**
![Flashcard2](img/flashcardpage2.jpg?raw=true)
Users will see a page analogous to Tutorial Page 2 with the user's input stories displayed.

**See My Stories 2- Answers**
![userinputstories](img/seemystoriespage.jpg?raw=true)
Users can go to this page to see their previously input stories to review, or edit.
