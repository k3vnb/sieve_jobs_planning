#### Planning Session Notes

After re-reading 'Thinking in React' and puzzling over how best to break down my UI, I made a preliminary draft.
###### Flashcard UI

###### Tutorial UI

###### Component Tree Draft

I believe there will need to be lots of revisions, especially to the component tree, at this time I realize the further away I get from the top of the component tree, the more abstract the concept feels, and I think I need to start plugging away at some of the higher components to get a better feel for how the information will start flowing.
